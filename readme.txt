== Frequently Asked Questions ==

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Will the plugin fully copy custom post type items?
Yes. The plugin works with all custom post types and the duplicate record contains the same taxonomy associations and metadata as the original.

### Can I duplicate an item's main fields, without the taxonomy and metadata?
No. A _partial copy_ isn't a _carbon copy_, after all.

### How do I copy something?
Visit the admin page for the post, page, or custom post type that you want to copy. Hover any row and you will see a link to _Duplicate_ the item. If you are currently editing an item, there's also a _Duplicate_ button available. In either place, you can use _CTRL+click_ to open the newly created item in a new tab.

### Where are the setting located?
There are no settings. The plugin is designed to _just work_.

### What about short URLs – won't duplication break something?
It would, yes. And that's why, when you duplicate an item that supports permalinks, the newly created item will have a hyphen and a number appended to it. You can then change the permalink for the new item to whatever you like. And, if you happen to forget to change the permalink on the new item, at least it won't break anything.
